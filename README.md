# Spotify-clone
Spotify Clone is a visually replica of Spotifyâ€™s interface, built using HTML and CSS.

This project focuses on front-end development, ensuring a responsive and pixel-perfect design that mirrors the aesthetics of the popular music streaming platform. Utilizing modern CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid, the layout is structured for seamless adaptability across devices. While it does not include functional backend features, the clean and modular codebase makes it an excellent foundation for future enhancements, such as integrating playback functionality or user authentication.
